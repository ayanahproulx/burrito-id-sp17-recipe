HTML &amp; CSS Recipe
I choose this recipe because it is something I make atleast once a week. I think it is delcious and super quick. P
eople definitley get less scared of vegan food when they know it tastes good and isn't absurdley difficult. This is one maine reason I was struggling with the banner I wanted to do. After several attemptes with code to put photos in a gride and overlap text (2 things I couldnt figure out how to do) I made it on illustrator.

I really want to keep adding more to my page and make it a pink and white fun food party explosion. 
I want it to be cute and also make the food seem appetizing; something a little different from the other pages, going against the simple and beautiful, mine can be a little louder and more pink.
